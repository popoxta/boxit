### Learning Outcomes
My learning outcomes for this project were to create fully fleshed out application with a connected backend.
<br>
I thoroughly enjoyed working on the backend, and wish to do more in the future - I especially found working with endpoints and middleware particularly fun!
Implementing user authentication was an absolute blast - however CORS did give me a touch of struggle!

Feel free to check out my design file in FIGMA linked below - I've even kept in my very high-level 'pseudocode' for a bit of insight to my implementation process.
